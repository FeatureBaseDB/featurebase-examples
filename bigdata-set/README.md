# Analyzing Millions of Draws of Set the Game with FeatureBase 
Today, we're going to take a look at using [FeatureBase](https://featurebase.com/) to analyze a very large number of draws of [Set the Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)) in real-time.

## Set (the game)
Set is a card game designed by Marsha Falco in 1974 and published by Set Enterprises in 1991. The deck consists of 81 unique cards which vary in four different features: number of shapes (one, two, or three), shape (diamond, squiggle, or oval), shading (solid, striped/dashed, or open), and color (red, green, or purple). 

You may be interested in discussions about the probabilities for the game:

In a game of Set, the cards are shuffled and then 12 cards are drawn from the top of the deck and placed on the table. Players must then try to identify sets within this initial draw. If no sets are found, 3 more cards are added until a set is identified. 

As an example, a draw of 12 cards could contain 12 different sets:

Like this example, we are going to focus on intial draws only. We won't be pulling sets from the board or dealing new ones from the remainder of the deck. We'll simulate millions of draws from deals of 12, 15 and 18 cards each.

## Run FeatureBase
This example requires FeatureBase is running on your computer. To get FeatureBase running quickly, ensure you have Docker installed and then begin by cloning this repository locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/FeatureBaseDB/featurebase-examples.git
cd featurebase-examples/docker-simple
```

Start the FeatureBase container:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

A more detailed guide for starting FeatureBase is available [here](https://github.com/FeatureBaseDB/featurebase-examples/tree/main/docker-simple#readme).

## Install Requirements
To run this example, you will need to install a few Python libraries. To install these automatically, run the following:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the Dashboard
Start the Set application by running the following:

```
python3 main.py
```

*OUTPUT*:
```
81 cards found
1080 sets found
14009373 draws found
