<p align="center">Create a simple project with FeatureBase Cloud and Anvil.works all in python! </p>

This example provides a ground-zero approach from no data or environment all the way to fully implemented local data generation, FeatureBase Cloud, and functioning web-app. All this solely with free online tools and a laptop. 

## ⚡️ Quick start

First, let's get the free Cloud accounts set-up and then we'll move to local environment tools. 

Navigate to the FeatureBase website and setup a free cloud trial [here](https://cloud.featurebase.com/signup)

Next do the same for a free Anvil.works account [here](https://anvil.works/)

Lastly, we'll be using Jupyter Notebook locally for a few steps and install steps can be found [here](https://jupyter.org/install)

  >For mac users you'll need a package manager to install both Python 3 and Jupyter (latest notebooks require Python 3). One option is [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), and the following code helps with that method.
  > 
  > Install Latest Python 3
  > ```bash
$ pyenv install 3.x.x
```
