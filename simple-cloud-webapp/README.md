<p align="center">Create a simple project with FeatureBase Cloud and Anvil.works all in python! </p>

This example provides a ground-zero approach from no data or environment all the way to fully implemented local data generation, FeatureBase Cloud, and functioning web-app. All this solely with free online tools and a laptop. 

## ⚡️ Quick start

First, let's get the free Cloud accounts set-up and then we'll move to local environment tools. 

Navigate to the FeatureBase website and setup a free cloud trial [here](https://cloud.featurebase.com/signup)

Next do the same for a free Anvil.works account [here](https://anvil.works/)
